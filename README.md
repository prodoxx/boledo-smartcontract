# Boledo Smart Contract

This is an open-source solidity smart contract implementation of the popular national Belizean gambling game called Boledo.

The probability of winning tends to be higher compared to the lottery as a winning number can be from 00 to 99.

Depending on the amount of **pieces** that are bought, that's the proportionate amount of the pool of cash a winner can have. There also can be multiple winners and the pool of money is divided by all winners depending on the amount of **pieces** of that specific winning number they bought.
